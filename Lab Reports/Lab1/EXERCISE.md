## **Goals**
* Understanding filters
  1. Low Pass Filter(LPF).
  2. High Pass Filter(HPF).
  3. Edge Detection.
* Implementing 2D Convolution.
* Importance of metrics in computer vision.
* Understanding the importance of numpy.

## **Lab Session**
1. Lab 0 Recap.
2. Anaconda installation and insights.
3. Implementations of Filters and trying them with scipy conv2d implementation.
   1. HPF.
   2. LFP.
   3. SobelX/Y
4. Implementing 2D Convolution(Conv2D).
5. Implementing Mean Square Error(MSE).

## **Final Report**
1. Complete the unfinished lab session tasks.
2. Run Conv2D(what you implemented) with your filters and measure the MSE between your conv2d implementation and the one from scipy you should receive low errors.
3. Read the Canny Edge Detection OpenCV documentation  and use it on messi's and the zebra image using the default parameters, show your results in the final report.
4. Write a short TL;DR (too long didn’t read) summary on the TL;DR text cell and describe your solution and what you understood in the lab.

## **Guidelines**
1. Code written in the assignments MUST follow the PEP-8 guidelines, we will deduct points of code not following this guideline, points will be accumulated.
2. You may use either Google Colab or Local Jupyter notebook session.
3. Use Markdown cells in-between your code cells to explain what you’ve done.
4. Assignments must be submitted as .html with all the required plots.
Some exercises will require online reading, you may use Google and stackoverflow for inspiration, although if you use it make sure to attach the reference link. 
5. Add as much comments you need to explain yourself, you wouldn’t want to assume we fully understand your
intuition.
6. Code should be well ordered, formatted and readable.
